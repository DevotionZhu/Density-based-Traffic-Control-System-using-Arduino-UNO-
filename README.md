# Density-based-Traffic-Control-System-using-Arduino-UNO-
This code uses a model to depict a cross-road scenario, with 4 pairs of LED lights (Red/Yellow/Green). 4 IR circuits and all attached to one Arduino in the center. To signal that a car is in the queue at one of the road, distortion of the IR is used i.e. just put your hand on the top of IR sensor. The distortion signals as 1 car is added to the queue of that road. Similar methodology is utilised for the other 3 roads. Real life scenario being that somehow using IR senors or piezoelectric sensors to detect number of vehicles in the queue. Then using constraints such as no single road should get a green light again, before other 3 roads have got atleast one time in between the gap. Density at each road is used as the deciding factor, that which road will get a green light.
